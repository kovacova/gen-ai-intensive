You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

The canvas was often primed with multiple layers of gesso, creating a smooth, durable surface.  Underpainting (a monochrome or toned layer) was frequently used to establish values and composition before applying the final layers of color.\n* **Fat over Lean:**  This crucial principle dictates that each subsequent layer of paint should be richer in oil (fatter) than the previous layer.

He yearned for something more, for a tale to tell, a story to wag his tail about.\n\nOne sunny afternoon, while sniffing a particularly tempting patch of grass, Barnaby discovered a hole. Not just any hole, but a hole that whispered of adventure. It was a narrow passage, shrouded in darkness, and it smelled of mystery. Barnaby, his tail wagging with anticipation, squeezed through the opening.\n\nThe world beyond was a magical labyrinth of tunnels and hidden chambers. He scampered through shadowy passages, his nose twitching with excitement. He encountered a colony of mischievous squirrels, who challenged him to a race through the maze of trees. He befriended a wise old owl, who shared stories of forgotten kingdoms and whispered secrets of the night.\n\nOne day, Barnaby stumbled upon a hidden garden, bursting with vibrant flowers and the scent of ripe berries. In the center, he found a tiny, forgotten city. The buildings were crumbling, but the streets were paved with cobblestones, and the air hummed with the echoes of a long-forgotten civilization. Barnaby, his heart pounding, explored the city, marveling at its grandeur and the remnants of its past.\n\nAs days turned into weeks, Barnaby’s journey took him through lush forests, across rushing rivers, and over rolling hills. He met a family of rabbits who taught him the language of the wind, and a pack of wolves who shared their hunting secrets. He learned to navigate by the stars and to communicate with the animals around him.\n\nFinally, after weeks of adventure, Barnaby found his way back to the familiar patch of grass where his journey had begun. He emerged from the hole, a changed dog. He was no longer just Barnaby, the terrier mix. He was Barnaby, the explorer, the adventurer, the storyteller.\n\nHe walked home, tail wagging furiously, and greeted his family with a bark that echoed with the excitement of his journey. He couldn't wait to tell them all about the squirrels, the owl, the hidden city, and the secrets he had discovered. From that day on, Barnaby’s life was filled with new adventures, each one more thrilling than the last, all thanks to the courage to explore and the wonder of the unknown. And every night, as he curled up by the fire, Barnaby would dream of the day he would return to his beloved secret world, the world that had forever changed him. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

You can even create your own custom themes.\n\n* **Integrate with various tools:**  It supports virtual environments (venv, conda, node), showing which environment is currently active.\n\nThe script achieves this by defining a series of functions that:\n\n1. **Detect the Git repository:** Checks if the current directory is within a Git repository.\n2. **Fetch Git status:** Executes `git` commands to gather information about the repository's state.\n3. **Format the output:** Processes the collected information and formats it according to the selected theme.\n4. **Integrates into shell prompt:** Modifies your shell's `PS1` variable to include the formatted Git information.\n\n\nIn short, it's a powerful tool for making your Git workflow more efficient and visually appealing.
